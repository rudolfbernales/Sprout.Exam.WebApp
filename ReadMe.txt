If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.


ANSWER: One feature that I believe can be implemented with this current application is a good time record/time tracker for the 
employee where user can input their Time-in/out. With these feature, we will not able to type manually the number of days that the employee work or the number of absenses he/she
have during a certain cutoff but we will able to compute their salary based on their time record.
